use textart for flashiness
display title & game rules at startup
maybe have save feature

program - user has to go across each tile so they can go PAST go
without having to land on it BUT not activate any other tile
(other than Go) when they bump across it
solution - countdown - if dicerole number >1 continue bumping
and do not activate tile. Go exception - activate tile regardless.
